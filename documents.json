  "description": "SCP-7746-Time is a temporal anomaly directly linked to the concept and utilization of currency. It appears that 'time', as understood in conventional physics, is intrinsically tied to the economic concept of 'money'. In absence of monetary transactions and wealth, time appears to cease advancing, granting effective immortality to human subjects.",
